# Mapty Project

Mapty is a project created as part of an Advanced JavaScript course on [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by instructor Jonas Schmedtmann. The project uses a Geolocation API to determine the user's location and a third-party library called Leaflet to display a map on half of the page. The user can click anywhere on the map to add a cycling or running workout using a form. The workout data is then stored in a list and the local storage of the browser, so that the user doesn't loose his/her workout data whenever the come to for the next timne.

## üí° Getting Started

To view this project, simply access [this link](https://hariyebk.github.io/Mapty/). Alternatively, you can also download or clone the repository from
[GitHub](https://github.com/hariyebk/Mapty) using the following command. 

```
git clone https://github.com/hariyebk/Mapty.git
```
Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Mapty application.

## ‚≠ê Using Mapty

When you first open the Mapty application, you will be prompted to allow the browser to access your location. If you allow access, the application will zoom in on your current location on the map. If you decline access, the map will default to a location in London.

To add a workout, simply click on the map at the location where you want to start your workout. This will open a form where you can enter details about your workout, including the type of workout (cycling or running), the distance, the duration, and any notes you want to include.

After you submit the form, your workout will be added to the list of workouts on the left-hand side of the page. You can click on any workout in the list to view its location on the map.

To delete a workout, simply click on the "Delete" button in the specific workout you are interested to delete. You can also clear all workouts by clicking the "Clear Workouts" button at the bottom of the workout list.

## üìçFuture Improvements

While Mapty is a fully functional application, there are several areas where it could be improved. Some possible improvements include:

- Adding support for more workout types, such as swimming or hiking
- Allowing users to edit existing workouts
- Adding the ability to share workouts with others via social media or email
- Making the application responsive so it looks good on all devices
